# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer
The setter function when invoked is called with the new 'useState'. Since it is a different useState technically than the previous state. This tells react that the state needs to be updated. Since it is not the same one as prior.

"current state and a set function that updates the state."
