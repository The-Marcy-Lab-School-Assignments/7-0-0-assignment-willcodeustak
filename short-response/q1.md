# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer
React is a library for building reusable,composable and scalable user-interfaces. React is made out components-a piece of the UI
that has its own logic and appearance. They can be as small as a button or as large as an entire page.

React components are javascript functions that return markup.These functions are used to define and control parts of the user interface. 

This allows developers to build applications that scale efficiently. Efficient scaling like tree's
